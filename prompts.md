Can you help me practice this part? I would like to do the following:

- I'd like to practice fill in the blanks
- create 30 sentences with missing words which I should fill up to practice this
- please go sentence by sentence and don't throw in all the sentences together
- when I make a mistake, show me the right word and explain the logic behind why that is the right answer
