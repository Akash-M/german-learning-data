### B1 German Cheat Sheet: Application & Fluency

-----

At this level, you're not learning new fundamental rules for accusative and dative. You are expected to use them
correctly and automatically in more complex situations. The goal is to stop thinking about the rules and start using
them instinctively.

Your understanding of the cases will be the foundation for more advanced concepts:

* **Adjective Endings**: The endings you add to adjectives (**der** schön**e** Garten, **in dem** schön**en** Garten)
are determined by the noun's gender, case, and the type of article.
* **Relative Clauses**: When you use a relative pronoun (`der`, `die`, `das`), its case within the new clause also
follows the accusative and dative rules.
