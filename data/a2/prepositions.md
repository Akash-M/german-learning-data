### **A2 Level**

At this level, learners expand their understanding with more complex prepositions that often take the dative case and 
are used to express time and more specific locations.

* **bei** (at, with a person, near) - *Always Dative*
* **von** (from, by) - *Always Dative*
* **seit** (since, for a period of time) - *Always Dative*
* **gegen** (against, around a time) - *Always Accusative*
* **durch** (through) - *Always Accusative*
* **um** (around, at a time) - *Always Accusative*


# Temporale Pr√§positionen (Time prepositions)

## seit (since, for)
- always in dativ case
- used to indicate the starting point of an action or event that continues into the present
- can be used with both specific points in time and durations
- often translated as "since" when referring to a specific point in time and "for" when referring to a duration
- Beispiel: `Ich wohne seit einem Jahr in Berlin`. (I have lived in Berlin for one year.)

## vor (ago, before)
- always in dativ case
- two-way preposition when used for location, but when used for time (as in "ago")
- used to indicate a point in time in the past
- Beispiel: `Ich habe ihn vor zwei Monaten gesehen`. (I saw him two months ago.)
