This grammar block explains the rules for **possessive articles** (`Possessivartikel`), which are words like 
`my`, `your`, `his`, etc., in German.

***
### 1. Basic Idea
Possessive articles are used to show ownership or belonging.

* *Das ist mein Auto.* (That is my car.)
* *Ist das deine Tasche?* (Is that your bag?)

The most important rule is that these words must be adjusted to match the noun they refer to. This means you have to 
consider the noun's **case** (nominative, accusative, dative) and its **gender** (masculine, feminine, neuter, plural).

### 2. The Rule for "mein-"
The grammar block uses "mein-" as an example to show how the endings change in each case.

| Case | Noun's Gender | Possessive Article Ending | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nominative** | Masculine | **-** (no ending) | `mein` **Vater** |
| (Subject) | Feminine | **-e** | `mein`**e** **Mutter** |
| | Neuter | **-** (no ending) | `mein` **Kind** |
| | Plural | **-e** | `mein`**e** **Freunde** |
| **Accusative** | Masculine | **-en** | `mein`**en** **Vater** |
| (Direct Object) | Feminine | **-e** | `mein`**e** **Mutter** |
| | Neuter | **-** (no ending) | `mein` **Kind** |
| | Plural | **-e** | `mein`**e** **Freunde** |
| **Dative** | Masculine | **-em** | `mein`**em** **Vater** |
| (Indirect Object) | Feminine | **-er** | `mein`**er** **Mutter** |
| | Neuter | **-em** | `mein`**em** **Kind** |
| | Plural | **-en** | `mein`**en** **Freunden** |

### 3. Important Points to Remember
This section gives you some helpful shortcuts for learning the system.

* **The endings often look like the definite articles** (`der`, `die`, `das`).
    * For example, the dative ending for feminine nouns is **-er** (`mein**er** Mutter`), just like the dative definite 
    article is **der** (`der** der** Mutter`).
* **Watch out for the dative plural.** You must always add an **-n** to the end of the noun itself, in addition to the 
  **-en** ending on the possessive article (e.g., `meinen Freund**en**`).
* **The system is exactly the same for all possessive articles** (`dein-`, `sein-`, `ihr-`, `unser-`, etc.).

**In summary:** Once you learn the endings for `mein-`, you know the endings for all of them. You just need to change 
the stem (`mein-`, `dein-`, `sein-`) to match the person who owns the object.
