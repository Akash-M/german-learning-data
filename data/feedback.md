## Weak areas

Based on your responses, you've made great progress, especially with the basics. You have a very good understanding of 
which possessive pronoun to use (e.g., `mein`, `sein`, `unser`), and you're getting better at applying the accusative 
case rules.

Your main challenge seems to be with the **dative case endings**. This is the most difficult part of this topic, and 
it's a very common sticking point for learners.

You're struggling with two things:

---

### 1. Confusing Dative Endings ðŸ”„

You sometimes mix up the dative endings for different genders.

* For example, you used the masculine/neuter ending **-em** for a plural noun (`meinem Eltern`), when the correct 
* ending should be **-en** (`meinen Eltern`).

---

### 2. Confusing Dative and Accusative Cases ðŸŽ¯

The biggest challenge is knowing whether a sentence requires the dative or accusative case, and then applying the 
correct ending.

* For example, you used **seinem** for `sein Auto`, but the verb `kaufen` requires the **accusative** case, and the 
* correct form is `sein` (no ending).

Here's a quick cheat sheet to help you see the difference side-by-side. The possessive pronoun forms for **all** 
genders change in the dative, but only the masculine form changes in the accusative.

| Case           | Masculine (`der`) | Feminine (`die`) | Neuter (`das`) | Plural (`die`) |
|:---------------|:------------------|:-----------------|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Nominative** | **mein**          | **meine**        | **mein**       | **meine**      |
| **Akkusativ**  | **meinen**        | **meine**        | **mein**       | **meine**      |
| **Dativ**      | **meinem**        | **meiner**       | **meinem**     | **meinen**     |
